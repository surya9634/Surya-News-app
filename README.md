# About

The Python script is a simple news application called "Surya News App" that uses the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and the requests library to fetch news from the internet. Hereâ€™s a brief, non-technical description:

This app allows users to search for news articles by entering a keyword or selecting from predefined categories such as "AI," "Technology," and "Entertainment." The app then fetches the latest news related to the chosen category or search keyword from an online news API and displays it within the app. The user can navigate through different news articles using the "Next" button.

The app has a clean, black-themed interface, and users can also click on buttons with images related to different news categories. This allows for an easy, visual way to browse news.
